# Amazon-Shipping

 
This project involves creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze and optimize Amazon's shipping operations. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key shipping metrics such as delivery times, shipping costs, package volumes, and customer satisfaction.  

**Key Objectives:**  
- Track and visualize delivery performance, including on-time delivery rates and average delivery times across different regions.  
- Identify trends in shipping costs and their correlation with delivery speed and package volume.  
- Monitor customer satisfaction related to shipping (e.g., complaints, ratings, and feedback).  
- Highlight bottlenecks in the shipping process, such as delays caused by weather, logistics, or regional issues.  
- Enable data-driven decision-making for improving efficiency and reducing costs.  

**Features:**  
1. **Delivery Performance Analysis:**  
   - A heatmap displaying regional delivery performance.  
   - Bar charts comparing on-time delivery rates by courier or time periods.  

2. **Shipping Cost Insights:**  
   - Trend lines showing monthly shipping costs and their breakdown (e.g., fuel, labor).  
   - Scatter plots of cost vs. delivery speed.  

3. **Package Volume Trends:**  
   - Line charts illustrating package volumes by day, week, and month.  
   - Segmentation by package type, size, or weight.  

4. **Customer Satisfaction Dashboard:**  
   - Customer satisfaction scores and complaint trends.  
   - Word cloud of common complaints related to shipping delays.  

5. **Interactive Filters:**  
   - Filters to drill down by region, time frame, shipping partner, and delivery type (e.g., standard, express).  

**Tools and Techniques Used:**  
- **Tableau** for data visualization.  
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Tools like Excel, SQL, or Python to preprocess shipping data.  
- **KPIs:** On-time delivery rate, average delivery time, shipping cost per package, and customer satisfaction score.  

**Outcome:**  
The dashboard provides Amazon's operations team with a comprehensive view of their shipping performance, enabling them to identify inefficiencies, reduce costs, and improve the customer experience.
